## AI Usage

We're trying to actually learn, so:
- YOU MAY NOT use ai to write code for you
- YOU MAY NOT use IDE agent mode
- YOU MAY use ai to help understand concepts
- YOU MAY use ai to explain errors
- YOU MAY use ai to give a roadmap for completing a task

> If you decide to use ai, please insert this custom prompt into your ai's memory/rules [MGGU](https://github.com/transicle/Silly-Scripts/blob/main/MGGU.md).
