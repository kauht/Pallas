# Pallas
A programming language written in C

## Introduction
In Greek mythology, Pallas is the epithet for Athena—the goddess of wisdom, craft, and strategy. The name is perfect for this project because it's a language that's both powerful and intelligently designed, like how Athena represents strength and intelligence.

Pallas is designed to be a familiar systems and general purpose programming language. Keeping the low level control of C, but implements it with a safer, modern design.

### Language History
Pallas is a completely original language with syntax and language features inspired by C/C++ and Rust. This is a personal project I'm using as a learning experience for future projects, and is heavily inspired by my friend [Lily](https://github.com/transicle)'s programming language, [ADAN](https://github.com/cappucina/adan).
